# -LLM-Evaluation-Tool-for-Entity-Extraction
 Build a tool that evaluates and compares the performance of multiple LLMs on extracting structured entities from PDFs or text documents.  The tool should generate detailed reports comparing each model’s accuracy, latency, token usage,  and cost, helping us identify which model performs best for real-world document understanding  tasks
